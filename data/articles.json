        "The Pomodoro Techique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used while he was a university student. A goal of this technique is to reduce the effect of internal and external interruptions of focus and flow.",
