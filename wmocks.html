          topic: "Some people think that schools should focus more on practical skills, while others believe academic knowledge is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.", 
          answer: "Schools should teach both theory and practice. Write about how practical skills (communication, teamwork, money management) help students in real life. Then discuss how academic knowledge (math, science, literature) builds understanding and innovation. Conclude that education must balance both teaching students to think deeply and apply knowledge wisely." 
        },
        { 
          topic: "Many believe that technology makes people less social. To what extent do you agree or disagree?", 
          answer: "Technology can isolate people when overused—like spending hours online instead of meeting others but it also connects families and friends across distances. Write about how social media reduces face-to-face interaction, then mention how video calls and online communities strengthen bonds. Conclude that technology doesn’t make people less social; how we use it does." 
        },
        { 
          topic: "Some people think that studying abroad is better for students, while others believe studying in their home country is more beneficial. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", 
          answer: "Studying abroad offers exposure to new cultures, languages, and global perspectives, helping students become independent and open-minded. However, studying at home is cheaper, emotionally easier, and strengthens local connections. Conclude that while both have advantages, studying abroad provides broader experience and personal growth that home education often cannot match." 
        },
        { topic: "Some people think children should start school at a very young age, while others believe they should begin later. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", answer: "Early schooling helps children develop faster and adapt to learning routines, while later start allows emotional maturity and stress-free childhood. Conclude that a balanced age combining play and learning is best for healthy growth." }, 
        { topic: "Some believe university education should focus on practical skills for employment, while others think it should teach theoretical knowledge. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", answer: "Practical learning improves job readiness, while theoretical study builds critical thinking and innovation. Conclude that universities should mix both to prepare students for real-world challenges." },
        { topic: "Many people think that public transport should be free for everyone. To what extent do you agree or disagree?", answer: "Free transport reduces pollution and traffic, but it can burden government budgets. Conclude that partial subsidies or discounts are better solutions than completely free transport." },
        { topic: "Some people believe students should learn foreign languages from primary school, while others think it should start in secondary school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", answer: "Early learning builds fluency easily, while older students grasp grammar better. Conclude that starting in primary school is more effective for long-term language mastery." },
        { topic: "Some people think traditional teaching is better than modern online learning. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", answer: "Traditional classes offer discipline and face-to-face interaction, while online learning gives flexibility and access to global resources. Conclude that combining both methods provides the best education." },
        { topic: "Many believe governments should spend more money on public services than on arts. To what extent do you agree or disagree?", answer: "Public services are vital for daily life, but arts inspire creativity and culture. Conclude that governments should support both to create a balanced, vibrant society." },
        { topic: "Some people think school exams are the best way to assess students, while others believe continuous assessment is better. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", answer: "Exams measure performance under pressure, while continuous assessment shows consistent effort. Conclude that a mix of both ensures fair and accurate evaluation." },
        { topic: "Some think living in big cities is better, while others prefer life in the countryside. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", answer: "Cities offer job opportunities and modern comfort, while countryside life gives peace and closeness to nature. Conclude that choice depends on lifestyle, but balanced urban planning can offer both." },    
        { topic: "Some people think young people should choose their own careers, while others believe parents should guide them. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", answer: "Freedom allows passion and motivation, while parental advice provides wisdom and safety. Conclude that youths should decide but respect their parents’ experience." },
        { topic: "Many people think climate change is the biggest threat to humanity, while others believe there are more urgent problems. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", answer: "Climate change affects all life globally, while poverty and war cause immediate suffering.
