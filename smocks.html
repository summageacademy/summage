        { question: "What do you do in your free time?", answer: "In my free time, I enjoy a mix of activities that help me relax and stay productive. One of my favorite things to do is read books, especially novels or non-fiction, as they allow me to escape into different worlds or learn something new. For instance, I recently finished a historical fiction book that was both gripping and thought-provoking. I also love spending time outdoors, like going for walks or cycling, because it helps me clear my mind and stay active. On top of that, I often catch up with friends over coffee or try out new recipes in the kitchen, as cooking is a bit of a creative hobby for me. While I do enjoy these activities, I sometimes just unwind by watching a good series or movie when I need to switch off. Overall, I like to balance my free time between staying engaged and simply relaxing." },
        { question: "Do you enjoy cooking?", answer: "I’d say I really enjoy cooking, as it’s not only a practical skill but also a creative outlet for me. I find it incredibly satisfying to experiment with different ingredients and flavors, especially when I’m preparing meals for my family or friends. For instance, I love trying out new recipes from various cuisines, like Italian or Thai, and tweaking them to suit my taste. That said, I don’t always have the time to cook elaborate dishes, so I tend to stick to simpler recipes during busy weeks." },
        { question: "How often do you meet your friends?", answer: "I usually meet my friends about once or twice a week, depending on our schedules. We’re all quite busy with work or studies, so we make it a point to catch up over the weekend, often grabbing a coffee or going out for a meal. For example, we might meet at a local café to chat and unwind, or sometimes we plan activities like watching a movie or going for a hike. That said, with some of my closer friends, we also stay in touch through calls or texts almost daily, so even if we don’t meet in person, we’re still connected. I think these meetups are really important because they help us stay close and share what’s going on in our lives." },
        { question: "What is your favorite type of music?", answer: "I really enjoy listening to a variety of music, but if I had to choose, I’d say indie and acoustic music are my favorites. There’s something about the raw, authentic sound of acoustic guitars and heartfelt lyrics that resonates with me. For example, I often listen to artists like Ed Sheeran or The Lumineers when I’m relaxing at home or driving. That said, I also appreciate upbeat pop music when I’m in the mood to lift my spirits. Music, for me, is a way to connect with my emotions, and I love discovering new artists or genres to broaden my taste."},
        { question: "Do you like to travel?", answer: "Absolutely, traveling is one of my passions because it opens up new perspectives and experiences. I love exploring different cultures, trying local foods, and visiting historical sites. For instance, last year I traveled to Japan, and exploring Kyoto’s temples was unforgettable. However, I don’t get to travel as often as I’d like due to work commitments, so I make the most of short weekend trips nearby. Traveling not only broadens my horizons but also helps me appreciate the diversity of the world."},
        { question: "How do you usually spend your weekends?", answer: "My weekends are usually a mix of relaxation and catching up on things I enjoy. On Saturdays, I often meet friends for brunch or go for a long walk in a nearby park to unwind from the week. For example, I love visiting a local nature reserve to enjoy the fresh air. On Sundays, I tend to focus on personal hobbies like reading or cooking a new dish. That said, if I’ve had a particularly busy week, I might just stay home and binge-watch a series. I try to strike a balance between being active and recharging for the week ahead."},
        { question: "Do you prefer reading books or watching movies?", answer: "I enjoy both, but if I had to pick, I’d lean toward reading books because they allow me to imagine the story in my own way. Novels, especially thrillers or historical fiction, really draw me in with their detailed storytelling. For instance, I recently read a mystery novel that kept me hooked until the last page. That said, I also love watching movies, especially when I’m in the mood for something visual and immersive, like a sci-fi blockbuster. It really depends on my mood, but books tend to leave a deeper impression."},
        { question: "What kind of food do you like to eat?", answer: "I’m a big foodie, so I enjoy a wide range of cuisines, but I’d say Italian and spicy Asian dishes are my top choices. There’s something so comforting about a well-made pasta dish, like a creamy carbonara, and I love the bold flavors of Thai or Indian curries. For example, I recently tried making a spicy tom yum soup at home, which was both challenging and rewarding. While I enjoy indulgent meals, I also try to balance them with healthier options like salads or grilled vegetables during the week."},
        { question: "Do you like to exercise?", answer: "Yes, I enjoy exercising because it keeps me energized and helps me stay healthy. I usually go for a jog or do some yoga a few times a week, as they’re great for both physical and mental well-being. For instance, I find yoga particularly relaxing after a long day. That said, I’m not a gym enthusiast, so I prefer outdoor activities like cycling or hiking when the weather’s nice. Exercise, for me, is less about building muscle and more about feeling good and staying active."},
        { question: "What is your favorite season?", answer: "I’d say autumn is my favorite season because of the cool weather and vibrant colors. The changing leaves and crisp air make it perfect for outdoor activities like hiking or simply enjoying a coffee outside. For example, last autumn, I went on a scenic walk through a nearby forest, and the views were breathtaking. That said, I also appreciate summer for its warmth, but autumn’s balance of mild weather and natural beauty really stands out for me."},
        { question: "Do you enjoy shopping?", answer: "I enjoy shopping to an extent, especially for clothes or gadgets, but I’m not someone who spends hours in malls. I prefer shopping online because it’s more convenient, and I can compare prices easily. For instance, I recently bought a new pair of headphones after researching different brands. That said, I do enjoy visiting local markets for fresh produce or unique handmade items, as it feels more personal. Shopping is fun for me as long as it’s purposeful and not overwhelming."},
        { question: "What is your favorite holiday or festival?", answer: "My favorite holiday is probably New Year’s because it’s a time for reflection and new beginnings. I love the excitement of celebrating with family or friends, whether it’s through a big dinner or watching fireworks. For example, last year, I hosted a small New Year’s party at home, and it was such a joyful evening. I also appreciate the chance to set goals for the year ahead, which makes the holiday feel meaningful and motivating."},
        { question: "Do you like to watch sports?", answer: "I’m not a huge sports fan, but I do enjoy watching certain events, like soccer or tennis, especially during major tournaments like the World Cup or Wimbledon. There’s something exciting about the energy and competition. For instance, I watched the last World Cup final with friends, and we had a great time cheering together. That said, I’m more of a casual viewer and prefer playing sports like badminton with friends for fun rather than watching them regularly."},
        { question: "What is your favorite place to visit in your city?", answer: "One of my favorite places to visit in my city is a local park that has a beautiful lake and walking trails. It’s a peaceful spot where I can relax, read a book, or just enjoy nature. For example, I often go there on weekends to unwind and take photos of the scenery. It’s also a great place to meet friends for a picnic. I think having such a calming space in a busy city makes it really special."},
        { question: "Do you prefer spending time alone or with others?", answer: "I enjoy both, but it depends on my mood. Spending time alone allows me to recharge and focus on personal hobbies like reading or journaling. For instance, I love curling up with a good book on a quiet evening. However, I also value time with others because it’s a chance to connect and share experiences. Meeting friends for coffee or having family dinners always lifts my spirits. I think a balance of both is what keeps me happy."},
        { question: "What kind of movies do you like?", answer: "I’m a fan of a wide range of movies, but I particularly enjoy thrillers and dramas because they keep me engaged with their intense plots and deep characters. For example, I recently watched a psychological thriller that had me guessing until the end. That said, I also enjoy lighthearted comedies when I want to relax and laugh. I think movies are a great way to experience different emotions and stories without leaving home."},
