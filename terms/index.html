      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>Summage Academy</strong> ("we," "our," "us"). By accessing or using our website, creating an account, or participating in any features, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the site immediately.</p>
      <p>Last updated: December 27, 2025</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>2. Our Purpose and Services</h2>
      <p>Summage Academy is an educational platform dedicated to supporting learners in their English language journey, with a strong focus on IELTS preparation. We provide lessons, mock tests, reading materials, study tools, research surveys, AI powered essay evaluation, a blogging section, and other interactive features.</p>
      <p>Users can create accounts to personalize their experience, track progress, earn virtual coins, publish blogs, receive NFT gifts, and for eligible bloggers, earn real money through our monetization program.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>3. User Accounts and Registration</h2>
      <p>To access personalized features, you must create an account by providing accurate information such as email and password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>
      <p>You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum age required in your country to register. By creating an account, you confirm that you meet this age requirement and that all provided information is true and complete.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts at any time for violations of these Terms, suspicious activity, or any other reason.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>4. Coins System and Virtual Currency</h2>
      <p>Summage Academy uses a virtual currency called "coins" that users can earn through activities such as completing research surveys, receiving high AI estimated IELTS band scores on essays, daily logins, or other engagement.</p>
      <p>Coins can be used to unlock premium content, features, or to send special NFT gifts to bloggers as appreciation or donations.</p>
      <p>Coins are non transferable, have no real world monetary value outside the platform, are not redeemable for cash directly, and do not constitute property. We may adjust balances, earning rates, or rules at any time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>5. Research Surveys and AI Essay Evaluation</h2>
      <p>Users may earn coins by participating in optional research surveys or submitting essays for AI evaluation with coins awarded for estimated band scores of 7 or higher.</p>
      <p>Submissions must be honest, original, and human created. Fraudulent, plagiarized, low effort, or AI generated content may result in withheld rewards, coin deduction, or account suspension.</p>
      <p>AI band score estimations are for practice only and are not official IELTS results.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6. Blogging Section</h2>
      <p>Registered users may create and publish blog posts. All content must comply with our Acceptable Use rules in Section 10.</p>
      <p>Users can send platform specific NFT gifts to bloggers using coins. These NFTs are digital collectibles unique to Summage Academy.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to moderate, edit, or remove any blog post or NFT gift at our discretion.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>7. Blogger Monetization Program</h2>
      <p>Bloggers with a minimum of 100 subscribers may qualify for our monetization program.</p>
      <p>Earnings are calculated based on CPM (cost per mille impressions) and CPC (cost per click) from advertisements displayed on blog posts. Rates are determined by our system which analyzes traffic quality, user engagement, geographic origin, and other factors.</p>
      <p>Higher quality, genuine traffic results in higher CPM and CPC rates. Rates are not fixed and may fluctuate based on traffic performance.</p>
      <p>We actively monitor for invalid traffic including bots, fake subscribers, automated views, or artificial ad clicks. Detection of such activity may result in reduced rates, suspended earnings, withheld payments, or permanent removal from the monetization program.</p>
      <p>Eligible bloggers can view earnings statistics, traffic analytics, and other tools in their dedicated Blogger Dashboard.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>8. NFT Gifts and Redemption</h2>
      <p>NFT gifts received from users can be collected and displayed in your profile.</p>
      <p>Bloggers may exchange received NFTs for real money through our platform redemption system. The exchange value is determined by us and may vary.</p>
      <p>All NFT redemptions are final. We reserve the right to adjust values, limit redemptions, or suspend this feature at any time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>9. Payouts and Withdrawals</h2>
      <p>Earnings from the monetization program and NFT redemptions can be withdrawn once a minimum threshold is reached with details available in the Blogger Dashboard.</p>
      <p>We support payouts to Visa, Mastercard, HUMO, and UzCard bank cards, as well as cryptocurrency wallets including Bitcoin, USDT, and others as announced.</p>
      <p>Users are responsible for any fees, taxes, or compliance with local laws related to receiving payments. We may require identity verification before processing withdrawals.</p>
      <p>Processing times vary by method. We reserve the right to delay, cancel, or reverse payouts if fraud or violations are detected.</p>
